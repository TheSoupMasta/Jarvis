Siri-Type Search engine/Chatbot


Intructions on use:
The search engine has 2 choices for searching, Google or WolfRamAlpha. WolfRamAlpha requires a client ID, so unless you make an APP ID and put it into the code, the WolfRamAlpha button will throw errors. Google button will just open a webpage with your search content, not so exciting.

The speech recognition part is the button that says "Use Speech Recognition" in the search engine page. Click it and press the click to speak button. If you want to index WolfRamAlpha, you can just ask your question, like, "What time is it?". If you want to index google, you have to prefix your queries with "Google", such as, "Google What is the weather?"
